`TraceQC` is a versatile tool. It is not only for performing Quality Control but also for running analysis. This document shows how to load the object to run a phylogenetic reconstruction using `phangorn` and `ggtree` package.

First, we are going to load `TraceQC` package and an example object (`example_obj`).

```{r}
library(TraceQC)
data(example_obj)
```

Next, `build_character_table` in `TraceQC` will convert the object to a list that contains a matrix and sequence information.

```{r}
tree_input <- build_character_table(example_obj)
```


Finally, we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree with the following code.

``` {r}
library(phangorn)
library(ggtree)
data <- phyDat(data=tree_input$character_table,type="USER",levels=c(0,1))
dm <- dist.hamming(data)
treeUPGMA <- upgma(dm)
treePars <- optim.parsimony(treeUPGMA, data)

ggtree(treePars) +
  geom_tiplab()
````
